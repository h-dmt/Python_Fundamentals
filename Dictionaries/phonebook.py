Each entry should have a name and a number (both strings) separated by a "-".
If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, update its number.
After filling the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N. Your program should
be able to perform a search of contact by name and print its details in the format:
"{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print:
"Contact {name} does not exist."
