"""You are up to handle the referee's little notebook and count
the players who were sent off for fouls and misbehavior.

    The rules: Two teams, named "A" and "B" have 11 players each.
    The players on each team are numbered from 1 to 11.
    Any player may be sent off the field by being given a red card.
    If one of the teams has less than 7 players remaining,
    the referee stops the game immediately, and the team with less than 7 players
    loses.

The card is a string with the team's letter ("A" or "B")
followed by a single dash and the player's number.
 e.g., the card "B-7" means player #7 from team B received a card.
The task: You will be given a sequence of cards (could be empty),
separated by a single space.
You should print the count of remaining players on each team at the end
of the game in the format:
"Team A - {players_count}; Team B - {players_count}".
If the referee terminated the game, print an additional line:
"Game was terminated".

ยง Note for the random tests: If a player who has already been sent off receives another card - ignore it.
